## Installation
First make sure that [Node](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
>Note: To check if Node is installed, open up a terminal and enter `node -v`.

If you see something like `vxx.xx.x`, you are good to go.
If you get an error instead, install Node following the instructions on the official [Node](https://nodejs.org/) website.

Now that you have Node installed, run `npm install`.
This will install all the required packages.

## Running the application
First make sure that [Angular](https://angular.io/cli) is installed.

Type `ng serve` in the console to run the Angular server.
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.
